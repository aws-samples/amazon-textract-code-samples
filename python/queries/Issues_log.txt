Issue: I have a multiple pages PDF and 1st page is landscape orientation, which is the envelope cover with some text like "Presorted" etc.
When I run through the PDF, I am getting the below error since from the output of "d = t2.TDocumentSchema().load(response)" line it is expecting 
"block_type = 'PAGE'" in the next line of code "page = d.pages[0]". I get the below error, but when I remove the first page and run, I get proper queries output. I am guessing if the code "t2.TDocumentSchema().load(response)" is not handling multi page pdf? Please advise.
